# Hey there! Allow me to introduce myself...
First and foremost, thanks for stopping by! I'm Andrew, a software developer originally from "[Almost Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vrEljMfXYo)", the home of pepperoni rolls, Fallout 76 and Mothman. I've worked out of Silicon Valley since April of 2024 across teams located in both Sunnyvale, CA and Seattle, WA.

# Where I started, where I am now and where I'd like to be...
I've been programming since 2012 and since then my passion has always been writing game engines.

While I had some initial success at self-teaching and implementing some foundational computer graphics-related concepts and patterns at a time when my ratio of "time-to-responsibilities" was at an all-time high, unfortunately, it eventually came time to put aside my passion in favor of career development so that I could, at the very least, spend my working hours doing something software-adjacent. Ultimately, I'd like to get back to writing engines of some kind whether it be for games, simulation, visualization or, more broadly, interactive media applications in general. In the meantime, I will continue contributing to regulatory compliance initiatives, CI/CD improvement campaigns and whatever else needs done until I am presented with an opportunity to continue from where I left off or discover a fascinating new niche.
